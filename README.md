# 2D Robotic Arm 

This project is a Python-based simulation of a 2D robotic arm using OpenGL. The arm consists of three segments (upper arm, forearm, and hand) with joints that can be controlled interactively using the mouse or keyboard.

## Features
- **Interactive Controls**:
  - Use the mouse to rotate the shoulder, elbow, and wrist joints.
  - Reset the arm to its default position using the `r` key.
- **Visualization**:
  - Real-time rendering of the robotic arm with color-coded joints.
  - Smooth animations using OpenGL.
